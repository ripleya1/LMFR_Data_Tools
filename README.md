# CSCI 380 Project for Last Mile
This was a semester-long project with Last Mile to update their functions and create a GUI.

## GUI
If you are on a Windows computer, the GUI is runnable as the .exe file in the /dist directory. 
If you are on a Mac computer, the GUI is runnable as the .app file in the /dist directory.

### Compiled GUI
To generate / regenerate a compiled GUI, follow the steps below. Note: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed beforehand.

If you are on a Windows computer, open and run [WINDOWS_recompile_gui.bat](WINDOWS_recompile_gui.bat).
If you are on a Mac or Linux computer, open and run [MAC_recompile_gui.sh](MAC_recompile_gui.sh).
